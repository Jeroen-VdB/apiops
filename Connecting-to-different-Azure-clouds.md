We connect to the Azure public cloud by default (``https://management.azure.com/...``). However, you can change this by setting ``AZURE_CLOUD_ENVIRONMENT`` in configuration to one of these values:

| Value | Cloud |
| --    | --    |
| ``AzureGlobalCloud`` | Azure public cloud |
| ``AzureChinaCloud`` | Azure China |
| ``AzureUSGovernment`` | Azure Government |
| ``AzureGermanCloud`` | Azure Germany |
